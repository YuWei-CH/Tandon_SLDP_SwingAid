# Tandon_SLDP_SwingAid
SwingAid is a prototype of a smart baseball bat. It uses multiple sensors (force sensor, accelerometer) to sense the direction of human movement and the force of the baseball bat hit. An Arduino Nano is used as the processor, with an I2C-based display to show the data.

<br /> Hareware: Arduino Nano(1), Force sensor(3), accelerometer(1), 5v_battery(2), 10K resistors(1), 220K resistor(1), LCD-Display screen(1), wires(serval)
<br />Software: Arduino IDE
<br />Other: Baseball, Bat

<br />This project is a group collaboration project, thanks to Chris's contribution in appearance design, product creativity and baseball skills. Thanks also to Garvin for his efforts in 3D CAD model.
